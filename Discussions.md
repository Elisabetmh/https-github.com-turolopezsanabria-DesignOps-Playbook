# Discussions

We use the feature [Discussions](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions) from Github to organise most of the conversations around SUI Components: New component, proposals, doubts, weeklies, etc. 

### Categories

**General:** This category is for everything that doesn't fit in the others. It's the one we used to create the [notes](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions/1778) for Hacktoberfest 2021.

**Ideas and new features:** Use this one if you want to propose a new component, feature, improvement, etc.

**Q&A:** Use this category to start a conversation if you don't have permission to chat in our Slack channel. 
We also use this category to store unanswered questions from slack.

**Weekly Sync Streaming:** All the weekly meeting notes are saved including the number of week and date. We are still not including videoclips summarising the session, but it's something someone proposed and we'll probably start doing soon.
