# Mobile 1st approach

Every component in SUI should follow a Mobile 1st approach.

In practical terms it means not only that each component should work perfectly in a mobile device, but also that every new Design, Discussion, Suggestion or Pull Request should take that into consideration.

### Follow these simple rules:

- The design specs must be for mobile first
- Avoid displaying more information on hover (such as tooltips)
- Provide solutions for touch only devices that don't provide hover
- Think how the elements will behave if they are forced to break in more than on line
- etc
