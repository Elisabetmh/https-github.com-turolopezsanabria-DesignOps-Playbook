## Our focus, role, and responsibilities

This team has been created with the aim to reduce friction and stress in our processes and technology, bridging the gap between Developers and Designers with clear communication and a common language, while improving our focus on native applications.

### Processes

We define and iterate processes that enhance _HOW_ we do things, for Designers, Developers, and Researchers to focus on _WHAT_ and _WHY_ we do it.

* We help designers and developers to work faster
* We simplify design and development workflows
* We create processes, explore to detect inefficiencies, propose solutions and facilitate their adoption

### Tools

We foster and support tools that promote and improve communication between teams.

We are always exploring the ecosystem proactively, market trends, "the hype", and assessing the potential impact of a future change.

* We provide methods to deliver quality effortlessly
* We pick the best tools for the team and our budget
* We sync with Central Teams and Procurement to give everyone access to relevant tools
* We ensure uptime, and firefight as soon as possible when something goes wrong

### Design Systems

We lead the efforts on Design Systems, aiming to improve the quality of implementation, adoption, documentation, and visibility.

* We create, maintain, and deliver Design Systems and Guidelines (Brand, UI, Content, MKT, etc)
* We update and improve our UI Kits based on the latest tools' feature releases
* We don't make strategic design or product decisions for any team, but we help create the Visual language for each brand

### Professional development

We focus on creating a good environment for the success of the entire team, ensuring everyone has access to the latest right resources.

### Visibility

We help communicate the value of our Design and Development teams outside and inside the organisation.

* We document every agreement and push everyone to document as well
* We communicate proactively to ensure full transparency of our agreements
