## Our focus, role and responsibilities

We are a relatively new role in Adevinta, that emerges from the need to reduce friction and stress in our processes and technology, bridging the gap between Developers and Designers with clear communication and a common languaje, while improving our focus on native applications.

**These are our areas of action:**

### Processes

We define and iterate processes that enhance _HOW_ we do things, for Designers, Developers and Researchers to focus on _WHAT_ and _WHY_ we do it.

- We help designers and developers to work faster
- We simplify design and development workflows
- We create processes, explore to detect inefficiencies, propose solutions and facilitate their adoption

### Tools

We foster and support tools that improve communication between teams.

We are always exploring the ecosystem proactively, market trends, "the hype", and assess the potential impact of a future change.

- We foster tools that promote communication between teams and provide methods to deliver quality effortless
- We explore tools and decide which one is the best for the team and budget
- We sync with Central Teams and Procurement to give everone access to relevant tools
- We ensure uptime, and firefight as soon as possible when something goes wrong

### Design Systems

We lead the efforts on Design Systems, aiming to improve the quality of implementation, adoption, documentation and visibility.

- We create, maintain and deliver Design Systems and Guidelines (Brand, UI, Content, MKT, etc)
- We update and improve our UI Kits based on the latest tools' feature releases
- We don't make strategic design or product decisions for any team, but we help creating the Visual language for each brand

### Professional development

We focus on creating a good enviroment for the success of the entire team, ensuring everyone has access to the latest right resources.

### Visibility

- We help communicating the value of our Design and Development teams outside and inside the organisation.
- We document every agreement and push everyone to document as well
- We communicate proactivelly to ensure full transparency of our agreements
