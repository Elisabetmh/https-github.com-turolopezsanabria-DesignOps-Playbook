# Figma

Figma is our official tool for Design, Handoff and Prototyping.

{% hint style="info" %}
Although we've quit using **Sketch**, **Zeplin**, **InVision** and **Abstract**. If you need anything from our old accounts get in contact with your DesignOps or Slack [turo](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/D017VLGFLMV).
{% endhint %}

We have an Organisation Plan, with a team for each vertical and several projects for each of them.

### Licence

Regardless if you are a **Designer** or a **Developer**, you shouldn't need to request a seat because DesignOps manage licences automatically but, if you still don't have access, get in contact with [@turo](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/D017VLGFLMV) or write in [#tool-figma](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C01M4VBS744) and we will fix it fast.

### UI Kits ownership

All our UI kits are mantained by DesignOps (but hey, all help is welcome! just make sure you record every change writing a meaningful message.

### Version control in Figma

In contrast to code, all the Components in Figma live in a single file, we don't publish a single library per component and we don't name our UI Kits in Figma following MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH either. Use the libraries on the base that they are always up to date.

### Figma branches

Maybe we change this in the future but we have not found a valuable use for the feature _"branches"_ from Figma (yet).
