### Figma

Figma is our official tool for Design, Handoff and Prototyping.

**Credentials**
You should not have to request a seat, DesignOps manage licences and grant access to the right projects automatically.

If you still don't have access get in contact with [@turo](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/D017VLGFLMV) or write in [#tool-figma](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C01M4VBS744) and we will fix it fast.

{% hint style="info" %}
We've recently quit using **Sketch**, **Zeplin**, **InVision** and **Abstract**.

If you need anything from our old accounts get in contact with your DesignOps or Slack [turo](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/D017VLGFLMV) and they will help you.
