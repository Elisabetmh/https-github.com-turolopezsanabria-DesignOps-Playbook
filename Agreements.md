# Our Agreements

We've been working together for a long time now, these are our current working agreements:

### Feedback

- Record all conversations in [github discussions](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions)
- Record all the agreements in the comments' section of [github discussions](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions)
- Don't assume all blockers are urgent. Prioritise them in accordance to their severity
- Always update the Figma UI Kits after code rollouts
- Value certainty when making decisions: In the case of uncertainty, plan a Spike and minimise risks
- Use data to learn from previous experiences about speed, capacity, blockers, etc
- Close each issue after fixing the reported bug, defect or issue
- Communicate blockers as soon as possible (Slack and Weekly Syncs are perfect)
- Avoid scope and design changes during the development or iteration of a component
- Communicate the resolutions of all issues proactively
- Help us documenting all processes and agreements in this Playbook
- If we are forced to publish something with bugs or defects, make sure they are properly documented as [debt](UX-and-Technical-Debt.md)
- The right place to leave feedback for Design Proposals is Figma, in form comments or notes
- The right place to leave feedback for Code is the PR itself in gitHub, in form comments

### Communication

We value every effort to bring designers and developers closer together. The language you use should always be correct but not at the expense of providing clarity.

- Use vocabulary with clear meaning for both designers and engineers
- Choose words that provide mutual understanding over specificity
- Communicate what you are trying to achieve, and also what you are not trying to achieve as well
- Give examples and descriptions for new words
- Force yourself to be consistent with the vocabulary when writing and talking

### Judgment

There are many correct ways to do things and solve problems. Many times we have to make decisions without the help of best-practice examples to follow and move forward.
To deal with uncertainty and still move forward we foster having strong opinions, weakly held

- If you are in risk of geeting stuck due to ambiguity or difference of opinions, make decisions that will help us moving forward
- Make short term decisions based on long term goals
- Evaluate tools and integrations by the risk they present, not just the solution they offer. If the risk is high pay special attention.
- Prioritize solutions for people who use SUI Components and how it serves the customers who use products built with SUI Components
- Seek feedback on code review often, and more often when a solution takes you down a new path
- Take time to provide good code review, encompassing the above values when providing feedback

### Implementation

- Engineer just enough of a solution
- Value declarative over abstraction
- A little verbosity is better than clever code. Avoid implementations that reduce the ability for people to contribute
- Decrese repetition with abstraction and automation
- Provide flexibility, but within the boundaries of our agreeements
- Assume that people will break the rules, and provide safe ways for them to do so

### Innovation

- Avoid big bangs: Make small experiments that provide data
- Ship your ideas
- Ship often
- Work on reducing complexity and simplifying solutions to enable us to innovate faster
