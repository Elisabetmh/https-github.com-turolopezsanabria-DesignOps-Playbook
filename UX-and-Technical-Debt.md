# UX and Technical Debt

## UX Debt

UX debt is the sum of issues (friction between the user and the product) we've generated by releasing imperfect stuff into production.

As in Tech debt, it translates into additional time and effort cost that often results from launching faster / easier solutions, instead of releasing the best from the very beginning.

### What’s UX Debt & what’s not

Not everything pending to be developed is debt, many tasks belong to standard product evolution backlogs.

**It is UX Debt**

* User Interface issues (Overall aesthetics and branding elements)
* Interaction design issues (Ease of use, meeting standards and reutilisation)
* Content issues (Copy, content, and messaging)
* Information architecture issues (Findability and coherence)
* Accessibility issues (Contrast, visual focus indicators, text alternatives)
* Customer journey and cross channel consistency (Seamless experience across touchpoints and channels)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**It's not UX Debt**

* New features, even they are based on user needs
* Iterations on the MVP were planned initially as a later phase
* Technical bugs
* Performance issues
{% endhint %}
