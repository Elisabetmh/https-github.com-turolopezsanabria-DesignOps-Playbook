# UX and Technical-Debt

## UX Debt

UX debt is all the user experience issues our products accumulate over time because of releasing new stuff into production that introduces friction between the user and the product. 

Similar to Tech debt, it refers to the additional time and effort costs that result from launching faster or easier solutions, instead of releasing the best possible experience from the very begining.

## What’s UX Debt & what’s not


Not everything pending to be developed is debt, many tasks belong to standard product evolution backlogs.

### It is UX Debt

- User Interface issues (Overall aesthetics and branding elements)
- Interaction design issues (Ease of use, meeting standards and reutilisation)
- Content issues (Copy, content, and messaging)
- Information architecture issues (Findability and coherence)
- Accessibility issues (Contrast, visual focus indicators, text alternatives…)
- Customer journey and cross channel consistency (Seamless experience across touchpoints and channels)

### It's not UX Debt

- New features the team wants to develop based in user needs
- Iterations on the MVP planned initially as a later phase
