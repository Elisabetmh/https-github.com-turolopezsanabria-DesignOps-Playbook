This alignement is aimed to give visibility on the different initiatives around Design Systems in general: We check our [performance dashboard](https://pages.github.mpi-internal.com/scmspain/design-systems/), refresh ideas, review new proposals, and align on topics proposed by Designers and Develpers.

The agenda is public and stored in [github discussions](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions).

### Ad Hoc Syncs

We are biased towards action: The more aligned the better, the faster we can solve something the better.

If you have anything you would like to discuss open a chat in [#sui-components](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C018Q6WBJ85) or [#es-designops-community](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C01FCMJ9ZUZ) and we will arrange a meeting.
