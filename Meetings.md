# Meetings

There are two types of meetings in SUI Components:

### Weekly Sync

Open to the public and streamed in Twitch
[All the details here](Weekly-streamings.md)

### adHoc Sync

We are biased towards action: the more aligned the better, the faster we can solve something the better.

If you have anything you would like to discuss you can open a chat in [#sui-components](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C018Q6WBJ85) and we will arrange a meeting.
