### Meetings ad hoc

The more aligned the better, the faster we can solve something the better.

If you have anything you would like to discuss open a chat in [#sui-components](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C018Q6WBJ85) or [#es-designops-community](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C01FCMJ9ZUZ) and we will arrange a meeting.
