# Collaboration model

Every user can influence on the direction of the project through proposals, ideas and bugs reporting.

**We have Hybrid model**: A central team (DesignOps) is in charge of a big part of the work, but all the developers and designers at Adevinta contribute to the evolution of the system as a _federated_ team.

## Roles and key responsibilities

Although we all make SUI, each role has an expected contribution level

### Central team = Maintainers

Active contributors, with a high dedication to the project, are responsible of gathering insights and driving the strategic direction of the system.

The central team is in charge of:

* Maintainance
* Minor and Major initiatives
* Big architecture changes in sync with Enablers
* Tools assessment and definition
* Definition of standards
* Bureaucracy (meetings, retros, agenda, events, etc)
* System integrity
* Metrics dashboard
* Reinforcement of policies
* PRs reviews
* etc

## Contributors

All Adevintians can influence on the evolution of SUI and should be able to submit PullRequests to the project.

Regardless of your discipline, you can contribute with small and medium improvements such as:

* Bugs fixing
* PRs reviews
* Component improvements
* New features
* New components
* Design and Code Proposals
* Reinforcement of policies
* etc
