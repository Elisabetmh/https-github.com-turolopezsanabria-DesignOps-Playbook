# Weekly Sync streamings in Twitch

### Join us! We Sync every Wednesday at 12:30 in Twitch

Although the main focus of the talk use to be SUI Components, it's a weekly alignement for you to have visibility of the different initiatives around Design Systems in general: We check our [performance dashboard](https://pages.github.mpi-internal.com/scmspain/design-systems/), refresh ideas, review new proposals, and align on topics proposed by Designers and Develpers.

We save the **agenda** and past events in [github discussions](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions).

[Connect here!](https://www.twitch.tv/adevintaspaintech)
