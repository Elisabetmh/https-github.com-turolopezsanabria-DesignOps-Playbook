## Tips

* Be kind
* Share what you think, sincerelly
* Review dev work as soon as possible
* Give feedback soon and often
* Run the 1st review from a Mobile device
* Donâ€™t let your team skip UX Review in DoD
* Get used to run UX Reviews
* Use Figma comments @stakeholders
* Add context in your comments (links, device, etc)
* Record your feedback in Jira Tickets
* What goes into production is more important than the lines in the Code and the Figma files
