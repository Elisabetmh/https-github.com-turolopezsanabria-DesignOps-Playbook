# Feedback loops

- Record all conversations in [github discussions](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions).
- Record all the agreements in the comments' section of [github discussions](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions).
- Don't assume all blockers are urgent. Prioritise them in accordance to their severity.
- Always update the Figma UI Kits after code rollouts.
- Value certainty when making decisions: In the case of uncertainty, plan a Spike and minimise risks.
- Use data to learn from previous experiences about speed, capacity, blockers, etc.
- Close each issue after fixing the reported bug, defect or issue.
- Communicate blockers as soon as possible (Slack and Weekly Syncs are perfect)
- Avoid scope and design changes during the development or iteration of a component.
- Communicate the resolutions of all issues proactively.
- Help us documenting all processes and agreements in this Playbook.
- If we are forced to publish something with bugs or defects, make sure they are properly documented as [debt](UX-and-Technical-Debt.md)
- The right place to leave feedback for Design Proposals is Figma, in form comments or notes.
- The right place to leave feedback for Code is the PR itself in gitHub, in form comments.
