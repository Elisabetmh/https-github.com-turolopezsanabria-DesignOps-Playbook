# Values and Principles

### Simple

SUI Components are intended to be the simple base for complex, more advanced components. In SUI you will find the fundamental building blocks for you to think big without having to deal with the simplest pieces of your application. 

### Intuitive

Using and navigating through the options of the components should be easy peasy. And, in case you need to understand more, we've put together a comprehensive documentation.

### Customisable

SUI Components offer a wide range of options out of the box, and you can customise all of them using your own theme.

### Collaborative

We build SUI together. Check our collaboration model to learn more about or how we coordinate the efforts to build it collaboratively. 

### Retrocompatible

We pay special attention to the health of your app integrity hence we always try to avoid breaking changes and major versions of our tools and components.
