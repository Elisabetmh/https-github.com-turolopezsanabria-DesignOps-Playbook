## Areas of action

### Processes

We define and iterate processes that enhance _HOW_ we do things, for Designers, Developers and Researchers to focus on _WHAT_ and _WHY_ we do it.

### Tools

We foster and support tools that improve communication between teams.

We are always exploring the ecosystem proactively, market trends, "the hype", and assess the potential impact of a future change.

### Design Systems

We lead the efforts on Design Systems, aiming to improve the quality of implementation, adoption, documentation and visibility.

### Professional development

We focus on creating a good enviroment for the success of the entire team, ensuring everyone has access to the latest right resources.

### Visibility

We help communicating the value of our Design and Development teams outside and inside the organisation.
