# The source of truth

**We don't have one :)**

We've tried to force it for a while, but a really "single" source of truth is not feasible in a multi-disciplinary, multi-platform company. 

We encourage our designers and developers to ensure their tools and components are updated by fixing and reporting everything they find we need to fix.

This way Designers can work in Figma trusting that everything is correct the same way developers can asumme the code is correct and safe to be implemented.
