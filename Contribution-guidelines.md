# Contribution guidelines

## SUI Components

### Bugs and defects

If you find anything that needs to be adjusted [open an issue in github](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/issues/new?template=report-a-bug---issue.md).

**Important:** You don't need to open a ticket in Jira if the bug is only related with SUI.

### Improvements (existing components, tools, processes, etc)

We always start with a conversation, sometimes offline or through Slack, but always record it in a GitHub Discussion.

[Open a discussion](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions/new)

Discussions don't have templates yet, but we strongly recommend you to follow these guidelines:

* Share your idea as soon as possible, it doesn't have to be perfect to start a discussion
* Include all the possible data to get the conversation started
* When possible, start the discussion for Mobile 1st
* Tag other people to get them envolved
* Share your discussion through slack [in #sui-components](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C018Q6WBJ85)
* Save a spot in our [Design Critique](Design-critiques.md)
* Discuss your idea in our [Weekly Meeting](Weekly-streamings.md)

### New proposals (Components, Tools, Processes, etc)

You can start directly openning a GitHub discussion, but we recommend: 

1 - Use the [Figma template](https://www.figma.com/file/gwZ74U8HHbPl3l5vbwHHrO/Template---Specs-for-Components?node-id=706%3A626) to structure your ideas. It contains a handover checklist, notes for Accessibility, and the same layout we use for our demos in Studio.

2 - Then [start a discussion](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions/new) in GitHub to get everyone involved.
