# Contributing guidelines

## SUI Components

Share your ideas as soon as possible, it doesn't have to be perfect to start a discussion.

### 🐞 Bugs and defects

[Open an "Issue" in Github](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/issues/new?template=report-a-bug---issue.md).

We only use GitHub if it's only related with SUI, you don't need to open a ticket in Jira at this point.

* Share the improvement through slack [#sui-components](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C018Q6WBJ85)
* Share the idea in our [Weekly Meeting](Weekly-streamings.md) (Twitch)
