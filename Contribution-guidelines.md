# Contribution guidelines

## SUI Components

### üêû Bugs and defects

If you find anything that needs to be adjusted [open an issue in github](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/issues/new?template=report-a-bug---issue.md).

**Important:** You don't need to open a ticket in Jira if the bug is only related with SUI.

### ü™Ñ Improvements (existing components, tools, processes, etc)

We always start with a conversation, sometimes offline or through Slack, but always record it in a GitHub Discussion.

[Open a discussion](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions/new)

Discussions don't have templates yet, but we strongly recommend you to follow these guidelines:

* Share your idea as soon as possible, it doesn't have to be perfect to start a discussion
* Include all the possible data to get the conversation started
* When possible, start the discussion for Mobile 1st
* Tag other people to get them envolved
* Share your discussion through slack [in #sui-components](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C018Q6WBJ85)
* Save a spot in our [Design Critique](Design-critiques.md)
* Discuss your idea in our [Weekly Meeting](Weekly-streamings.md)

### üåö New proposals (Components, Tools, Processes, etc)

You can start directly openning a GitHub discussion, but we recommend: 

1 - Use the [Figma template](https://www.figma.com/file/gwZ74U8HHbPl3l5vbwHHrO/Template---Specs-for-Components?node-id=706%3A626) to structure your ideas. It contains a handover checklist, notes for Accessibility, and the same layout we use for our demos in Studio.

2 - Then [start a discussion](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions/new) in GitHub to get everyone involved.

## Figma

Figma is our official tool for Design, Handoff and Prototyping.

### Licence

We have an Organisation Plan, with a team for each vertical and several projects for each of them.

no matter if you are a **Designer** or a **Developer**, you shouldn't need to request a seat because DesignOps manage licences automatically but, if you still don't have access, get in contact with [@turo](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/D017VLGFLMV) or write in [#tool-figma](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C01M4VBS744) and we will fix it fast.


###¬†Ownership

All our UI kits are mantained by DesignOps but open to collaboration from anyone in the team. 

Just make sure you record every change you make writing a meaningful message. Start with infinitive verb and a simple explanation.

![Write comprehensive messages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turolopezsanabria/design-systems-playbook/master/ASSETS/version-control-figma.png)

### Version control in Figma

In contrast to code, all the Components in Figma live in a single file, we don't publish a single library per component and we don't name our UI Kits in Figma following MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH either.

You can use the libraries on the base that they are always up to date.

### Figma branches

Maybe this changes in the future but we have not found a valuable use for the feature _"branches"_ from Figma (yet).

## Native Apps

soon
