# Contributing guidelines

## SUI Components

We've simplified all our processes to the very minimum to have you covered with just a few steps.

Think simple and will move fast. Share your idea as soon as possible, it doesn't have to be perfect to start a discussion.

### üêû Bugs and defects

[Open an issue in github](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/issues/new?template=report-a-bug---issue.md).

We only use GitHub if it's only related with SUI, you don't need to open a ticket in Jira.

### ü™Ñ Improvements

[Open a discussion](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions/new)

If you want to enhance an existing component, tool or process start with a conversation in GitHub Discussion. Unfortunatelly templates are not available yet but we strongly recommend you to follow these guidelines:

* Include all the possible data to get the conversation started
* When possible, start the discussion for Mobile 1st
* Tag other people to get them envolved
* Share your discussion through slack [in #sui-components](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C018Q6WBJ85)
* Save a spot in our [Design Critique](Design-critiques.md)
* Discuss your idea in our [Weekly Meeting](Weekly-streamings.md)

### üåö New proposals

You can start openning a GitHub discussion to kickoff an idea for a component, tool or process, but we recommend:

1 - Use the [Figma template](https://www.figma.com/file/gwZ74U8HHbPl3l5vbwHHrO/Template---Specs-for-Components?node-id=706%3A626) to structure your ideas. It contains a handover checklist, notes for Accessibility, and the same layout we use for our demos in Studio.

2 - Then [start a discussion](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions/new) in GitHub to get everyone involved.

## Figma

We have an Organisation Plan, with a team for each vertical and several projects for each of them.

### Licence

No matter if you are a **Designer** or a **Developer**, you shouldn't need to request a seat because DesignOps manage licences automatically but, if you still don't have access, get in contact with [@turo](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/D017VLGFLMV) or write in [#tool-figma](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C01M4VBS744) and we will fix it fast.

### UI Kits ownership

All our UI kits are mantained by DesignOps but everyone can collaborate. Just make sure you record every change you make writing a meaningful message.

![Write a meaningful message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turolopezsanabria/design-systems-playbook/master/ASSETS/version-control-figma.png)

### Version control in Figma

In contrast to code, all the Components in Figma live in a single file, we don't publish a single library per component and we don't name our UI Kits in Figma following MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH either. Use the libraries on the base that they are always up to date.

### Figma branches

Maybe we change this in the future but we have not found a valuable use for the feature _"branches"_ from Figma (yet).

## Native Apps

soon
