# Getting started

## Welcome!

**SUI-COMPONENTS** is the **monorepo multi-package** project of **[Adevinta](https://www.adevinta.com/)** **Spain Design System React public components**. All React components are located under [**components**](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/tree/master/components) directory. Every single component is published as a complete pill with all its required dependencies. 

**SUI-COMPONENTS** use [sui-studio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@s-ui/studio) as a component prototyping tool. This tool requires a specific directory strategy for managing each package. This strategy force every single **component package** be included in a **component-category** directory. **SUI-COMPONENTS** follows the atomic design component category for grouping our design system components.

```
components/[componentCategory]/[componentName]
```
