# Getting started

**Welcome!** 

## Developer

You can start reading the [Contribution Guidelines](Contribution-guidelines.md) or jump directly to the section [SUI Components](SUI-Components.md).

By the way, you also need access to Figma to be able to inspect designs and prototypes. If you still don't have access, get in contact with [@turo](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/D017VLGFLMV) or write in [#tool-figma](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C01M4VBS744) and we will fix it fast.
