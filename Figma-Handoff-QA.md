# Handoff & QA

## Handoff
Today this transfer can be seen in different stages, since thanks to collaborative tools such as Figma, it is not necessary to finalize the design so that development can move forward or show proposals to assess and refine them in the different ceremonies of equipment.

## Design
Design delivery is the point in the product development process when designers confirm that they are done and deliver their final proposals.

They must consist of specifications by the design so that the development process is more fluid, it is necessary to give context, user flows and add functional labels that reinforce communication between teams, decision making in order to work more efficiently and agile.

## Tips for a correct delivery
 
### Communication
 
- The communication channels established by the "Slack" team will be used.
- Figma must be taken into account as the source of truth for both design and development.
- Sometimes we think that our team members understand how to use the software we use, in our case Figma, but this is not always the case, have a session with them to explain how the files and information are structured.
- Building the solution with the developers encourages making the transfer process easier and more efficient.
- It is important to get involved in the early stages of the development project in order to have the knowledge of what can be done or the effort it requires.
- Share with the team what the final design is, to reduce uncertainty and questions about what the final design is.
- At the end of the delivery, ask if there is anything that was not clear or if they need additional information.
 
### Organize the information during the design process
 
- It is important to add notes and information for the correct communication in the team (not only developers but any stakeholder).
- The use of sections can help to better organize the screens, flows and components.
- It is important to avoid creating confusion with many screens or sketches, so it is recommended to order the canvas and place only what corresponds to the iteration of the task to work on, to be able to focus and reduce noise when sharing.
 
### Documentation is easy to find and understand.
 
- Documentation can be added that explains the design behavior, interaction, or project requirements in a way that is easy to find and understand
Use a version history to document what has changed 
- Basic list: summary of some aspects to keep in mind for your release to be complete for development
- Happy and Unhappy path
- Use cases
- Assets
- Interaction / Animation / Prototype (if any)
- Component specifications
- We recommend using the checklist worked from DesignOps to help achieve the highest quality project delivery, functionality, and component usage. 
 
 
### Kit
In the common library you will find all kinds of components to be able to document design decisions.
 
Cards to leave notes in the flows, design reviews or decision making
 
You can use the variations of color and size to prioritize the screens, workflows and use cases.
 
Labels to name the screens or correctly named sections, so that they serve as a point of reference for anyone who accesses the file.

## QA

It is an essential part of product development, since it does not help to ensure that the implementation is in the correct way, according to the Agreements established with the team.
 
Carrying out quality control in the implementation of new product features must be constant to guarantee that what is in production or is about to go up and identify possible gaps in understanding between design and the rest of the team.
 
It is important to identify the cause of possible errors so as not to repeat them in the future, possibly due to communication errors, design errors, or development that lost some project information.
 
### Assets

We have worked on a series of resources, such as notes and other components to be able to do a deep and quality review with the team before going to production and if necessary for later, leaving a visual map of what was worked on in the Demo
 
The objective is achieve the highest quality of project delivery, functionality and use of components.

## Quality Playing Cards guidelines
From the DO team we have worked on a template of guidelines and tips with the intention of helping and accelerating to the teams in the Handoff.
 
The main objective of achieving the highest quality of project delivery.
 
This list is constantly being improved, so feel free to share it with the Design Ops team, any suggestions or feedback will be welcome.
