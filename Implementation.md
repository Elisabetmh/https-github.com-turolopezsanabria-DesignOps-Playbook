# Implementation

- Engineer just enough of a solution
- Value declarative over abstraction
- A little verbosity is better than clever code. Avoid implementations that reduce the ability for people to contribute
- Decrese repetition with abstraction and automation
- Provide flexibility, but within the boundaries of our agreeements
- Assume that people will break the rules, and provide safe ways for them to do so.
