# Slack

If you are not working at the office use Slack as the 1st option to chat with someone. 

These are our main channels (restricted to Adevintians)

- [#sui-components](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C018Q6WBJ85): Inform new PRs, ask help, stay up to date, ask questions and pitch ideas.
- [#sui-tools](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C018JRRK2NS): Similar to #sui-components but focused on the tools and not on  components.
- [#design-ops](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/G01ETB0PNMC): Direct line with DO, focused on team liturgies, projects, agenda, events and coordination of internal inititives. 
- [#tool-figma](https://adevinta.slack.com/archives/C01M4VBS744): Best practices, news, plugins, tips, credentials, etc
