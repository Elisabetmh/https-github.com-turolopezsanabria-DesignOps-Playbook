# SUI Theme

The components in SUI Library use **colour**, **typography**, **spacing** and other values from [SUI Theme](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui/tree/master/packages/sui-theme).

The theme is written in SCSS and all generic variables, functions, mixins and helpers can be customised in each brand. [Check the section Tokens](Tokens.md) to understand how it works.

## How to use

### Install sui-theme

`npm install @s-ui/theme --save`

### Import sui-theme

Include the path `@import '~@s-ui/theme/lib/index';` in settings.scss

# Brand themes

Each brand can customise all components using [tokens](Tokens.md) in its own Theme.
