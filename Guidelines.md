# Design System Guidelines

Our Brand guidelines and UI guides are housed in [Lingo](https://www.lingoapp.com/), not in Figma.

Lingo is a tool that combines the power of a digital asset manager with the context of a style guide. 
It allow us to organize all our visual assets in one place, creating and sharing living brand style guides, digital asset libraries and more. 
All while ensuring brand consistency.

### So, what's in Lingo and what's in Figma?

**In Lingo you'll find:**

* The source of style knowledge is Lingo, never Figma.
* The use of these components is documented in Lingo, not in Figma.
* Visual language is documented in Lingo, not Figma.
* Design patterns are documented in Lingo, not Figma.
* Writing guidelines are documented in Lingo, not Figma.

* In Figma there are the Component's Specs.

### FAQ

* The specs are made with the Figma new component template.
* The final component is added into the Figma UIKit.
* Guidance on when and how to use it is written at Lingo.

**Does an external have to design for us?**

* We share with her/him the Lingo link so you know how we designed for the Brand.

* Specs about states are not documented in Lingo.
