# SUI-Components

SUI is an Open-Source library of React Components for you to create, unify and evolve great web experiences.

It provides high quality tools and efficient processes as the source of truth for standards and best practices and, at the same time, streamlines communication between developers and designers.

It helps you ensure that the product you build is using the most modern and consistent assets available.

##Â Structure

SUI Components is just a part of the complete suite, along with [SUI Tools](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui) where you can find tools, Studio, Theme, etc.

The entire system is built in a modular way (["atomic design"](Atomic-design.md)) to help you getting started and running with minimum effort. Each component is an NPM package you can link and use directly, although it's always recommended you check our [documentation demo](https://sui-components.vercel.app/).
