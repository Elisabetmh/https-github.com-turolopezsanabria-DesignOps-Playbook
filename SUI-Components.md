# SUI-Components

SUI is an Open-Source library of React Components for you to create, unify and evolve great web experiences.

It's a CORE piece of our [Design System](Design-System.md)

## Structure

SUI Components is modular (AKA ["atomic design"](Atomic-design.md)), built in a way that helps you getting started and running with minimum effort.

Although it's always recommended you check our [documentation demo](https://sui-components.vercel.app/), each component is an NPM package you can link and use directly.

```
$ npm install @s-ui/react-atom-button --save
```
