# Collaboration model

**Our model of contribution is Hybrid**, a combination of _Centralised_ and _Federated_ team.

## Roles and key responsibilities

Although we all make SUI, each role has an expected contribution level:

### Central team

Active contributors with high dedication to the project, responsibles for gathering insights and driving the strategic direction of the system.

In charge of:

* Minor and Major initiatives
* Big architecture changes
* Tools assessment and definition
* Definition of standards
* Bureaucracy (meetings, retros, agenda, events, etc)
* System integrity - Maintainance
* Metrics dashboard
* Reinforcement of policies
* PRs reviews
* etc

## Contributors = Change makers

All Adevintians have strong influence on the evolution of SUI and should be able to submit PullRequests to the project.

Can submit any type of changes, but in general are expected to contribute with small and medium improvements such as:

* Bugs fixing
* PRs reviews
* Component improvements
* New features
* New components
* Design and code Proposals
