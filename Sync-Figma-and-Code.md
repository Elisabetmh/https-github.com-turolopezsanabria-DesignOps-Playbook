# Sync Figma and Code

**We don't have an automatic sync process between Figma and Code**

You need to update your side proactivelly to the changes made on the other side (code or Figma)

### In case of differences, which one is the source of truth?

The simplest answer is: **The right one**

In most of the cases, we know how a component should look like, as a matter of fact that's how we spot defects when we realise something is not as defined.

- If you find a defect in the code but your Figma file is OK: the code needs to be adjusted
- If you find a defect in your Figma file but the code is OK: the Figma file needs to be adjusted

### So, we don't have a single source of truth...

That's correct, we don't have a single source of truth. Designers work primarelly in Figma, and must assume that everything is OK in Figma. The same way Developers should always asumme that the code is correct.
