# Figma's Teams & Projects
At Adevinta we have a common Team & Projects organization to speed up sharing user flows around different marketplaces.

## Teams in Figma
Our work is structured with our Adevinta's Organization at the top. We propose that Figma's Teams will be for our Products and Figma's Projects will be their different areas of work.

Figma's Teams to group marketplaces and projects to differentiate the user, within them will be the initiatives, in collections of files where they will have branches with iterations of the design work.

Permissions in Figma are set at the team level. You can be a member of multiple teams, each with their own permissions. Each team will be assigned an admin who can grant editor access to new members.

## Projects in Figma
Each Team in Figma is equivalent to a marketplace (except for DesignOps and ResearchOps)

Projects allow us to group related design files together in a single space, like a folder.

To encourage consistent nomenclature and improve visibility, we propose the following project categories with a simple common convention:

1. **Search:** Also called Buyers for coches and MA, Seekers for RE and Candidates for Jobs.

2. **Publish:** Also called Sellers for coches and MA and Privates for RE.

3. **Cross touchpoints:** Every touchpoint or section not directly connected with a type of user, it means cross platform touchpoints such as Login, Home, Settings, Consents or Footer.

4. **PRO Tool:** Payment platform for our professional customers.

5. **Emails & Communications:** TBD description

6. **Landings:** TBD description

7. **Marketing:** TBD description

8. **Projects & Team Drafts:** TBD description

9. **Brand & UI Guidelines:** TBD description

10. **Archived:** Here you'll found every archived file or project.
