# Teams in Figma
Our work is structured with our Organization at the top, Adevinta. We propose that the team be that of our products and the projects be their different areas of work.

Teams to group marketplaces and projects to differentiate the user, within them will be the initiatives, in collections of files where inside they will have the branches with iterations of the design work.

Permissions in Figma are set at the team level. You can be a member of multiple teams, each with their own permissions. Each team will be assigned an admin who can grant editor access to new members.


# Projects in Figma
Each Team in Figma is equivalent to a marketplace (except for DesignOps and ResearchOps)

Projects allow us to group related design files together in a single space, like a folder.

To encourage consistent nomenclature and improve visibility, we propose the following project categories with a simple common convention:

**1. Search users:** Also called Buyers for coches and MA, Seekers for RE and Candidates for Jobs.

**2. Publish users:** Also called Sellers for coches and MA and Privates for RE.

**3. Cross touchpoints:** Every touchpoint or section not directly connected with a type of user, it means cross platform touchpoints such as Login, Home, Settings, Consents or Footer.

**4. Tool:** Payment platform for our professional customers.

**5. Emails & Communications :** TBD description

**6. Landings :** TBD description

**7. Marketing :** TBD description

**8. Projects & Team Drafts :** TBD description

**9. Brand & UI Guidelines :** TBD description

**10. Archived :** Here you'll found every archived file or project.
