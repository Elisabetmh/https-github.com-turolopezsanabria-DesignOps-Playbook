# Figma's Teams & Projects

At Adevinta we have a common Team & Projects organization to speed up sharing user flows around different marketplaces.

## Teams in Figma

Our work is structured with our Adevinta's Organization at the top. We propose that Figma's Teams will be for our Products and Figma's Projects will be their different areas of work.

Figma's Teams to group marketplaces and projects to differentiate the user, within them will be the initiatives, in collections of files where they will have branches with iterations of the design work.

Permissions in Figma are set at the team level. You can be a member of multiple teams, each with their own permissions. Each team will be assigned an admin who can grant editor access to new members.

## Projects in Figma for Marketplaces

Each Team in Figma is equivalent to a marketplace (except for DesignOps and ResearchOps)

Projects allow us to group related design files together in a single space, like a folder.

To encourage consistent nomenclature and improve visibility, we propose the following project categories with a simple common convention.

**01. [marketplace naming] - Users**
> User's flow, such as Listing and Detail, where [marketplace naming] could be Buyers for coches and MA, Seekers for RE and Candidates for Jobs.

**02. [marketplace naming] - Publishers**
> Publisher's flow, such as PTA and My Ads, where [marketplace naming] could be Sellers for coches and MA and Privates for RE.

**03. Common touchpoints**
> Every touchpoint or section not directly connected with a type of user, it means cross platform touchpoints such as Login, Home, Settings, Consents or Footer.

**04. [tool name]- Customers**
> Payment platform for our professional customers.

**05. Emails & Communications**
> Actions that enable users to interact with our products through email, push notifications. It should include all email templates in order to unify experience.

**06. Landings**
> Standalone web pages, created specifically for retention & adoption campaigns. It should include all landing pages in order to unify experience.

**07. Marketing**
