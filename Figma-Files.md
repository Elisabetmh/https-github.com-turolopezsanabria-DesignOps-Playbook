# Figma's Files Organization

## Structure and organization
Files in Figma are structured in a common way, organizing the pages within the file according to the design proposal.
 
- **Cover & Info:** Project Indicator and Scope
- **Pages:** These will be used to rank sections of the files
- **Canvas:** TBD

## Covers
To improve navigation within Figma, there is a set of common covers to use in projects.

It should be on the first page of each file and you can check it all in [UX Spain kit - Common Library](https://www.figma.com/file/0QxwRRgAU7206f2CjVPwzs/UX-Spain---Common-Library?node-id=1776%3A562)

Adding covers makes the thumbnail help to find a file.

For projects contain:
 
- Tags group.
- Brand background.
- Brand icon.
- Title of the project.
- Short description.
- Owners
- Platform indicator.

## Structure
Files in Figma are structured in a common way, organizing the pages within the file according to the design proposal.

At Adevinta we have a [Template File Started](https://www.figma.com/file/U63D587DKpldpuTY4kPPuu/Template-File-Starter) to unify the navigation and organization of the work files in the different marketplaces.

(Edit when agreed)
üì∏ **Cover & Info:** Incador of the project and scope.

üîé **Discovery:** We will find everything related to the research phase.

ü¶Ñ **Ideation playground:** Where we will start sketching.

‚ùñ **Components:** The necessary proposals will be dumped to later check if they are added to the libraries.

üå≥ **Master / Production:** The final proposals will be shown here according to branches.

## How do we archive files?

![Archived File in Figma](image.jpg)

1. Duplicate Figma file.

2. We rename the original ‚ÄúFigma file‚Äù to ‚ÄúFigma file‚Äù + (Archived + Q + Year). Comments, change log and external links are kept here. We move it to the Archived project, and update the cover's title.

3. Rename ‚ÄúFigma file (Copy)‚Äù to ‚ÄúFigma file‚Äù. This will be the one that will be clean to work with, without comments or version history, and from which we delete all the "branches" (pages) and the Discovery section.
