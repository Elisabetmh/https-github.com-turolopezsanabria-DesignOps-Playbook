# Figma's Files
At Adevinta we have a common [File Starter](https://www.figma.com/file/U63D587DKpldpuTY4kPPuu/Template-File-Starter) to unify navigation around different marketplaces.

## Covers
To improve navigation within Figma, there is a set of common covers to use in projects.

It should be on the first page of each file and you can check it all in [UX Spain kit - Common Library](https://www.figma.com/file/0QxwRRgAU7206f2CjVPwzs/UX-Spain---Common-Library?node-id=1776%3A562)

Adding covers makes the thumbnail help to find a file.

They all contain:

- Product team.
- Cluster.
- Title of the project.
- Platform indicator.
- Brand background.

## Structure
Files in Figma are structured in a common way, organizing the pages within the file according to the design proposal.

📸 **Cover & Info:** Incador of the project and scope.

🔎 **Discovery:** We will find everything related to the research phase.

🦄 **Ideation playground:** Where we will start sketching.

❖ **Components:** The necessary proposals will be dumped to later check if they are added to the libraries.

🌳 **Master / Production:** The final proposals will be shown here according to branches.

## How do we archive files?

1. Duplicate Figma file.

2. We rename the original “Figma file” to “Figma file” + (Archived + Q + Year). Comments, change log and external links are kept here. We move it to the Archived project, and update the cover's title.

3. Rename “Figma file (Copy)” to “Figma file”. This will be the one that will be clean to work with, without comments or version history, and from which we delete all the "branches" (pages) and the Discovery section.
