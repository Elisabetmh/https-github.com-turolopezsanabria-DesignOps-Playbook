# Components

Adevinta Spain uses React JS in all its different web pages.

## What is a component?

Conceptually, **components** are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

> Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

We group several components in different libraries depending on a list of characteristics.

- SUI-Components: public components. open-source. ui-library. @s-ui/react-[categoryName]-[componentName] named
- Adevinta-Spain-Components: public components. open-source. deprecated.
- Adevinta-Common-Components: private components 

All of them are SSR Compatible.
