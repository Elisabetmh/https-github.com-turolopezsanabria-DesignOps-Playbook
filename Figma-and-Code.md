# Figma and Code

Every component and every style is presente in Figma and Code, you can think of them as mirrors of each other for Designers and Developers. 

## Do Figma and Code sync automatically? 

No, we don't have an automatic process between Figma and Code. You need to update your side proactivelly to the changes made on the other side.

### In case of differences, which one is "The Source of truth"?

We don't have a _single_ source of truth. Designers work primarelly in Figma, and must trust that everything is OK in Figma. The same way Developers should always asumme that the code is correct.

### So, in case of differences, which one is "the right one"?

The one defined by the UX Team, that ideally should be correctly applied everywhere consinstently.

- If you find a defect in the code but the Figma file is OK: Adjust Code
- If you find a defect in the Figma file but the code is OK: Adjust Figma
- If you find a defect in Figma and also in Code: Adjust both
