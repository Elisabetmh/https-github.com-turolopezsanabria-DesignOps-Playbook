# Figma and Code

You can find every style and every component in Figma and Code, and they are (or should be) perfectly aligned.

## Do Figma and Code sync automatically? 

No, we don't have an automatic process between Figma and Code. You need to update your side proactivelly to the changes made on the other side.

- If you find a defect in the code but the Figma file is OK: Adjust Code
- If you find a defect in the Figma file but the code is OK: Adjust Figma
- If you find a defect in Figma and also in Code: Adjust both

### In case of differences, which one is "The Source of truth"?

We don't have a _single_ source of truth. Designers work primarelly in Figma, and must trust that everything is OK in Figma the same way Developers must asumme that the code is correct.

### So, in case of differences, which one is "the right one"?

The one defined and documented. If there's no documentation available, or it's deprected, you need to create it and attach it to the request.
