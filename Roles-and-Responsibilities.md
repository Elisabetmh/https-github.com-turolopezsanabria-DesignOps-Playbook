# Roles and Responsibilities

We take care of the operational part of the work so Designers and Developers can focus on improving our products.

Our role emerges from the need to reduce friction and stress in our processes and technology, bridging the gap between Developers and Designers with clear communication and a common languaje, while improving our focus on native applications.

## Role

- We help designers and developers to work faster, without scarificing quality
- We simplify design and development workflows
- We foster tools that promote communication between teams
- We sync with Central Teams and Procurement to give you access to tools
- We explore tools and decide what's the best for the team and our budget
- We update and improve our UI Kits based on the latest feature releases
- We create, maintain and deliver Design System guidelines (Brand, UI, Content, MKT, etc)
- We are in charge of our Design Systems

## Responsibilities

- We give service to the teams, without making strategic decisions for them. Each product is responsible for their product
- We help creating the Visual language of each brand, although the decisions are made by the brand and not DesignOps
- We provide UI Kits, Components and Tools for designers to use, but we don't design for them
- We ensure uptime, and firefight as soon as possible when something goes wrong
- We create processes and make all possible efforts to implement them, although its each team's responsibility to follow the rules
- We act to remove ineficiencies
- We document every agreement, and request Designers and Developers to document as well
- We ensure the transparency of our agreements
