## Design Systems Weekly

**Every Wednesday at 12:30 (30min)**

This is our weekly sync we made public to give visibility on the different initiatives around Design Systems for Adevintians and other collaborators.

We use it to review new proposals, refresh ideas, communicate the progress of different innitiatives, align on topics proposed by Designers and Develpers, and keep track of key metrics we track in our [performance dashboard](https://pages.github.mpi-internal.com/scmspain/design-systems/).

The agenda is always public and stored in our Design System's [github discussions](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/discussions).
